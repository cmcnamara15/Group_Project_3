## Description

Schedaddy is a Customer relationship management (CRM) platform with the intent to streamline your scheduling for your company. Schedaddy offers the ability to manage employees, roles, and schedules with the greatest of ease.

Our intention with Schedaddy was to try our hand at creating a modern CRM platform that could be used to create dynamic schedules for various types of companies.

During this project, we faced a couple of challenges. Our biggest challenge was our 2-week sprint to MVP. Despite the time constraints, we successfully built a solid baseline that formed the core of Schedaddy.
